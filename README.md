# Capstone 490
CS/INFX 490: Capstone Project

## Overview  
**Capstone** is a web-based platform designed to assist web sleuths in identifying potential leads between missing persons and unidentified bodies. By aggregating data from multiple sources, the system allows users to compare cases side-by-side, filter information, and uncover possible matches.  

## Features  
- Search and filter **missing persons** and **unidentified persons** databases  
- Side-by-side comparison of cases to find potential matches  
- User accounts to **save potential matches**  
- Case request submission for missing/unidentified persons not listed  
- Web scraping integration for automated data collection  
- AI-assisted matching (future implementation)
